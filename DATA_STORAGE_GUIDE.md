# Data Storage Guide for Streamlit Deployment

## 📊 **How Data is Stored in Your Health App**

### **Current Implementation**
Your Personal Health Management app uses a **hybrid storage approach**:

1. **Session State** (Primary) - Data persists during your browser session
2. **CSV Files** (Backup) - Local file storage (not persistent on Streamlit Cloud)
3. **Export/Import** (Backup) - Download/upload functionality for data portability

## 🚀 **Streamlit Community Cloud Deployment**

### **What Happens to Your Data:**

#### ✅ **During Active Session:**
- All data is stored in **Streamlit Session State**
- Data persists as long as you keep the browser tab open
- No data loss during normal usage

#### ⚠️ **When App Restarts:**
- Streamlit Cloud restarts your app periodically
- CSV files are **NOT persistent** on the cloud
- Session state is **reset** when app restarts
- **Data will be lost** unless you export it

## 💡 **Recommended Data Management Strategy**

### **For Personal Use (Current Setup):**

1. **Daily Usage:**
   - Use the app normally during your session
   - Data is automatically saved in session state

2. **Before Closing Browser:**
   - Go to Dashboard → Data Management
   - Click "Export Data" to download your data
   - Save the ZIP file to your device

3. **Next Time You Use the App:**
   - Go to Dashboard → Data Management
   - Upload your previously exported data
   - Click "Import Data" to restore your history

### **For Production Use (Recommended Upgrade):**

Consider upgrading to a database solution:

#### **Option 1: Supabase (Free Tier)**
```python
# Add to requirements.txt
supabase==2.0.0

# Example implementation
import supabase
client = supabase.create_client(url, key)
```

#### **Option 2: Firebase (Free Tier)**
```python
# Add to requirements.txt
firebase-admin==6.2.0

# Example implementation
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import firestore
```

#### **Option 3: MongoDB Atlas (Free Tier)**
```python
# Add to requirements.txt
pymongo==4.5.0

# Example implementation
from pymongo import MongoClient
client = MongoClient(connection_string)
```

## 🔧 **Current Features for Data Management**

### **Export Functionality:**
- Downloads all your data as a ZIP file
- Includes: Profile, Weight Log, Diet Log, Workout Log
- Timestamped filename for easy organization

### **Import Functionality:**
- Upload previously exported ZIP files
- Restores all your historical data
- Validates file format before importing

### **Session Persistence:**
- Data stays in memory during your session
- No need to re-enter data during same session
- Automatic saving to session state

## 📱 **Mobile Usage Tips**

1. **Regular Backups:**
   - Export your data weekly or before major app updates
   - Store backup files in cloud storage (Google Drive, iCloud, etc.)

2. **Session Management:**
   - Keep the browser tab open during your session
   - Use "Add to Home Screen" for app-like experience

3. **Data Recovery:**
   - Always export before closing the app
   - Import data when starting a new session

## 🚨 **Important Limitations**

### **Streamlit Community Cloud:**
- **No persistent file storage**
- **No database included**
- **Session-based only**
- **Free tier limitations**

### **Workarounds:**
- Use export/import functionality
- Consider paid hosting with database
- Use external database services
- Regular data backups

## 💰 **Upgrade Options for Persistent Storage**

### **Streamlit Pro ($20/month):**
- Persistent file storage
- Better performance
- More resources

### **External Database Services:**
- **Supabase**: Free tier (500MB database)
- **Firebase**: Free tier (1GB storage)
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Free tier (512MB storage)

### **Alternative Hosting:**
- **Heroku**: Free tier available
- **Railway**: Free tier available
- **Render**: Free tier available

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

1. **Regular Exports**: Export data weekly
2. **Cloud Backup**: Store exports in cloud storage
3. **Version Control**: Keep multiple backup versions
4. **Data Validation**: Check imported data after restoration
5. **Session Awareness**: Know when data might be lost

## 🔄 **Migration Path**

If you want persistent storage, here's the upgrade path:

1. **Phase 1**: Current setup with export/import
2. **Phase 2**: Add external database (Supabase recommended)
3. **Phase 3**: Implement real-time sync
4. **Phase 4**: Add multi-device support
